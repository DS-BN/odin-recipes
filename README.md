Hi, Bodi from the future. If you are reading this, I hope you have a better idea of creating, extracting and adding directories with GitHub. With this HTML program I am
hoping to be able to cement some of the essential skills for web development. Note that the .md extension stands for markdown and it is a plain text format like .txt, with some differences that I couldn't care less about at the moment.

Ciao.
